This demo simulates synaptic bombardment of "in vivo like" conditions
in neocortical pyramidal neurons, based on the model detailed in 

Destexhe, A. and Pare D.  Impact of network activity on the integrative 
properties of neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo. J. Neurophysiol.
81: 1531-1547, 1999.
